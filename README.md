# Special Project

This project is designed for a special person, capable of easily filtering text with a list of input queries, serving the process of teaching and researching linguistics.

## Usage

To filter predefined words listed in the `query.txt` file inside the `inputs` folder, run

```
python filtered_words.py
```

The results will be saved in `outputs` folder.

**Structure of query.txt**

The query.txt file can contain:

* A single word.
* A list of words
  * In the case of a list of words, the order of the words will be maintained during the search.
